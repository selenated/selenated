# Hi, we're Sol
We're a plural system that's made a lot of things over the years- from various Discord bots to useful websites to handy tools and libraries. We're taking a break from development for now, but we've left up our collection of repos for anyone interested in learning from them or self-hosting our creations

Here's a look at some of our projects:

## Bots
You can find all of our bots on our [bots org](https://github.com/greys-bots), but here are some highlights: 

### Sheep ([repo](https://github.com/greys-bots/sheep))
A simple bot that allows users to change their name colors. Comes with lots of customization and utils, and has options for larger servers as well

### Form Fox ([repo](https://github.com/greys-bots/form-fox))
A highly customizable and feature-packed forms/applications bot. Offers a multitude of question types, answer-based logic for adding roles to accepted users, and plenty more options to configure

### Ticket Golem ([repo](https://github.com/greys-bots/ticket-golem))
A straightforward ticketing bot, letting users create private channels to speak directly with server mods

## Sites
We also like to make websites- though, at the moment, a lot of them are somewhat outdated and are in need of some hefty makeovers. 
You can find them in our [sites organization](https://github.com/greys-sites), but here are some we're willing to share right now: 

### Main website ([link](https://selenated.com)) | ([repo](https://github.com/greys-sites/website2))
Of course we had to make our own website. This is our go-to spot for sharing our projects and any updates for them

### PluralKit Web ([repo](https://github.com/greys-sites/pluralkit-web))
A web interface for the PluralKit bot. Now defunct, but the code is still available to look through. If this is ever revived, will probably be redesigned and rewritten with Sveltekit

## Tools & Libraries
Aside from bots and sites, we also like to work on libraries and various software tools :)  
You can find these in our [tools org](https://github.com/greys-tools)

### PKAPI.js ([repo](https://github.com/greys-tools/pkapi.js))
A Typescript library for interacting with the PluralKit API

### PK RPC ([repo](https://github.com/greys-tools/pk-rpc))
A Rich Presence Client (RPC) that can display your current fronters on Discord. Cross-platform and works out of the box

### Twitch Overlay ([repo](https://github.com/greys-tools/twitch-overlay))
A simple chat and alerts overlay setup for Twitch, built using JQuery and the server-sent events API
